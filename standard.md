# Company Technical Standard Template

This document is a template for a business or organization to develop their own internal technical standards documentation. 

## 1. Purpose

Information Technology is a highly technical and complex field.

This is distinct from industry standards, such as documents published by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

## 2. Scope

## 3. Specifications

### 3.1. Sections

This document is divided into standardized sections, which should be considered for inclusion in all new internal company technical standard documents. These sections have been derived and adapted from a variety of sources [a,d,e,b,f].

- Overview/Summary: This section briefly describes the contents of the Standard
- Purpose/Reason for Standard:

### 3.2. References

It is recommended that all references be cited in IEEE format [c]. IEEE is one of the most common citation standards used in computer science, information technology, information security, and electrical engineering. It is also relatively easy to use and understand. This ensures that all technical personnel reviewing the technical standard will be able to easily review reference materials, if desired. This template itself uses a slightly modified form of IEEE format.

## 4. Considerations

## 5. Compliance
